Release history:
"The original release date of this file is September, 2017."
This file supercedes the orginal file with the following changes:

"On March 12, 2018, 5 variables--SNAP benefits per capita, 2010; SNAP benefits per capita, 2015; SNAP benefits per capita (% change), 2010-15; Farmers' markets/1,000 pop, 2016; and Farmers' markets/1,000 pop (% change), 2009-16-- were corrected due to an error using the wrong population estimates in the denominator for 5 counties in South Dakota. These counties are Pennington, Perkins, Potter, Roberts, and Sanborn."
"On March 26, 2018, 4 variables--SNAP-authorized stores, 2016; SNAP-authorized stores (% change), 2012-16; SNAP-authorized stores/1,000 pop, 2016;  SNAP-authorized stores/1,000 pop (% change), 2012-16--were recalculated so that the weighting methodology for the number of stores in the county authorized to accept SNAP benefits in 2016 matched the weighting methodology used in 2012."


"Previous releases occurred in August 2015, February 2014, November 2012, June 2012, and January 2011."

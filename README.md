# Food Deserts In The Greater Chicago Area

The Executive Summary

Our hypothesis: 
What populations are most at risk of living in a food desert based on the Greater Chicago area?

Overall, our findings confirm our hypothesis. Lower poverty level populations of the Greater Chicago area are at higher risk for living in neighborhoods that have limited access to grocery stores. The repercussions of these food deserts can create lifelong health problems such as obesity, heart problems, and learning difficulties in children.

There may be a good amount of grocery stores in Chicago. However, it was clear that most of the affected population consists of people with low income who do not have easy access to these stores due to affordability or lack of transportation. 

We found the at/above poverty level population is less likely to receive SNAP benefits than those who are below. In terms of demographics, we found that people identifying as Black in the census poverty data were the majority of people receiving SNAP benefits and the minority identified as White or Asian.  

We found that households with low access to grocery stores received food benefits and for every household with a greater income, there were fewer that received food benefits. This ties back to our hypothesis and shows lower income households with less access to grocery stores receive food benefits.

If we had additional time to research, we would pick four additional cities such as LA, Atlanta, Philadelphia, and Seattle to analyze outside of just Chicago and compare against their urban food deserts to further understand the impact of lack of nutrition on lower income individuals and families across the US. 

#Using the Repo
The repo includes our data as .csv files as well as Jupyter Notebook files for code. Running Clean_Up.ipynb first creates clean .csv files to be used in Visualization_Analyis1.ipynb. Putting one's individual g_key in api_keys.py file is required to create all of the visualizations, which are then stored in the folder labeled "Images".
